# School and District Analysis


# Overview of Project
In this project we analyze student fundings and student math and reading test score, understand the trends and patterns of the grades, and accumulate the data to make decisions for future funding at the district and school level. For this challenge, We updated the scores for Thomas High School for the 9th graders due to academic dishoensty and compared the results obtained from both the analysis.

### Software Used

Python 3.8.5 


## Results

- The school district summary was not at all affected by the change of the values for the 9th graders at Thomas high school.


- The school summary after replacing the Thomas High school grades for math and reading for 9th graders affected the percentages of the school. Thomas High School presented a decrease in the percentages. The Passing math percentage was 66.9, the Passing reading percentage was 69.6, and the Overall passing percentage was 65.0 compared to the percentages calculated before. The before and after results for the Thomas high school summary are shown below.

- As mentioned above, replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores reduced the percentage of the Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools.

- The scores for Thomas High school were updated to include only the grades from 10th to 12th due to which the rest of the results were the same as the results obtained before replacing the 9th graders' scores.

 1. with a very minute difference, it reduced the average math score by grade and increased reading scores by grade. The average math and reading scores were: 83.41, 83.84, followed by the new score: 83.35, 83.89. 

2. Scores by school spending were not affected.
